20071031:
  - Fix support when NumLock/ScrollLock/CapsLock is on.

20071023:
  - Add support for {Super,Hyper}_{R,L} modifiers (aka Mod4Mask)

20070903:
  - Drag is now working. Problem was KeyEvent.state contains masks such as
    | Button1Mask which is set when mouse button 1 is held, so keybindings stopped
    | working. Ignoring Button[1-5]Mask in this value fixes the problem.
  - Drag takes two optional arguments: a button followed by a keysequence to fire.
    | 'drag 1 alt' will do an alt+leftclick drag.
    | 'drag 2' will do a middleclick drag.
  - sync to xdotool@20070903
  - Fix a bug in parse_mods and parse_keysym where it was destructively changing the string.
  - Fix a bug where I was using the loop iterator 'i' inside another for loop. Oops.
  - Add to defaults my nethack-vi-style diagonal keybindings


20070814:
  - Arguments for {move,cut}_{up,left,down,right} in form of percentage values.
    Default for cut is 0.5 (cut the window in half)
    Default for move is 1.0 (move the full width/height of the window)
  - More examples in distributed keynavrc
  - sync to xdotool-20070812

20070705:
  - Report when keysyms or keycodes cannot be looked up for whatever reason.

20070703:
  - Include COPYRIGHT (bsd license) and a sample keynavrc in the release.

20070629:
  - Correctly use defaults if no $HOME and no $HOME/.keynavrc is found (patch from wxs)
  - Clean target is now recursive
20070627:
  - Config file support. Loads ~/.keynavrc
    + The config file lets you much more than the original keynav.
  - Uses xdo for mouse activity
  - Some drawing fixes
