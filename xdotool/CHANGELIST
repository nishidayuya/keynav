20080606:
  * Correctly report an error if xdotool is invoked with an invalid command.
  * Fix invalid error code reporting from 'windowraise'

20080603:
  * Daniel Kahn Gillmor reported a problem with return codes from xdotool. All
    commands return proper exit status now (0 == success, nonzero == error)
  * I tested on 3 window managers: Gnome2 2.20.0, OpenBox 3.4, ion-3rc-20070608
    - Gnome and OpenBox pass all tests.
    - ion-3 fails on any desktop-related methods (ion-3 lacks the support).

20080601:
  * Add new commands:
    - windowactivate: Activate a window. If the window is on another desktop, we
        will switch to that desktop and then activate the window.
    - set_num_desktops number: Changes the number of desktops or workspaces.
    - get_num_desktops: Output the current number of desktops.
    - set_desktop desktop_number: Change the current view to the specified
        desktop.
    - get_desktop: Output the current desktop in view.
    - set_desktop_for_window window_id desktop_number: Move a window to a
        different desktop.
    - get_desktop_for_window window_id: Output the desktop currently containing
        the given window.

    windowactivate tested and confirmed working in: ion-3 and Gnome2 (metacity)
    The rest of the new commands have only been tested in Gnome2. They do not
    work in ion-3 due to lacking support for EWMH in ion.
  * Rewrote the man page in perlpod format.

20080521:
  * Import patches from keynav's xdotool branch (From Lukas Mai) which make
    xdotool compile happily when building with -Wall and -pedantic (and others)
  * Finally convert to using Window type for (hopefully) everything instead of
    incorrectly typecasting Window to int sometimes.
  * Confirmed that the one (but mostly useless) test passes.

20071230:
  * Manpage contribution by Daniel Kahn Gillmor
  * Add COPYRIGHT from svn to the distributed package.

20070903:
  * Add xdo_mousemove_relative for relative mouse movements
  * Add xdolib.sh. This is a script library to help with features xdo does not
    explicitly implement, such as querying window attributes, or fetching the
    root window id. An example which uses this is: examples/move_window_away.sh

20070812:
  * Magnus Boman contributed keysequence_{up,down} adding new commands to
    xdotool: keyup and keydown. These take the same arguments as 'key' but only
    send keyup or keydown events.
  * Lee Pumphret contributed getwindowfocus, which tells you the window id of
    the window currently holding focus.
  * Removed 'Makefile.no-pkg-config' because the original Makefile now knows
    how to build for both cases: with and without pkg-config.

20070722:
  * Compiles without warnings when using gcc -Wall now
  * Fixed false error reporting due to some functions missing return statements

20070713:
  * Add flag SIZE_USEHINTS to xdo_window_setsize
  * Add flag --usehints to xdotool windowsize

  Increments are used often in terminals that say "my font is 5 by 7 pixels, so
  resize by that increment". So, you can use this to set a terminal to be 80x24
  characters instead of pixels. Verified by resizing xterm and gnome-terminal
  (with menus enabled).

20070712:
  Added new search options to 'xdotool search'
    --onlyvisible shows only visible windows in the results
    --title causes only the window title to be matched
    --name causes the window name to be matched
    --class causes the window class to be matched

  For information on names and classes, check out the xprop tool.
    For example, for an xterm you will see this in the xprop output:
    WM_CLASS(STRING) = "xterm", "XTerm"
  "xterm" is the name, "XTerm" is the class. Don't ask me what the differences
  are supposed to be. ;)
